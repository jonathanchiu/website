          <p>
            I'm a 3rd-year Northeastern Univesity student, currently majoring in Computer Science. Most of my work experience is in web development, but I am open to all opportunities that come my way. I'm a firm believer in the never ending pursuit of knowledge and actively seek out all perspectives from those who want to share them with me. Want to chat? I'm listening.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside of my studies and code-related side projects, my interests include learning foreign languages and about different cultures, wiki'ing concepts and theories in the field of astrophysics and cosmology (even if I don't quite understand any of it), playing the guitar, spending time with friends, and when I'm feeling brave, imitating accents.
          </p>

            The jumbotron image is sourced from Christopher Nolan's 2014 film <em>Interstellar</em> and depicts a planet orbiting <em>Gargantua</em>, a rapidly rotating (fictional) supermassive black hole.

          A web application that fetches Tumblr posts based on a given username,
          and the specified post type. For example, giving 'tmagazine' as the username
          and selecting 'Text' as the post type will return all text posts posted
          by 'tmagazine.' Utilizes the Tumblr API for data retrieval and dynamic
          pagination for easy and organized navigation of the returned posts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still need to make more post types functional and design needs a lot of work. Basic functionality is there and currently only works with text, photo, and audio post types.

          Implemented a number base converter that converts between binary, decimal,
          octal, and hexadecimal numbers, as well as a tip calculator, for the Windows Phone Store. Their original purpose was to learn/explore more about programming apps for the Windows Phone.

          Both were written in C# and XAML, and were eventually submitted to Microsoft's 'Keep the Cash'
          promotion where I was awarded $200 for my app submissions.

          Calculates time dilation experienced by a hypothetical observer from the perspective of an observer at "rest", given a duration of travel and a speed at which
          the moving observer desires to travel at. Will determine how much time has passed for
          our hypothetical moving observer relative to the observer at rest
          utilizing the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_factor">lorentz factor</a>.

          really cool and incredibly bizarre.
